Coronavirus is affecting daily lives of people almost everywhere in the
world. The social impact as well as economic burden on personal and
state lavel is immense as countries and communities adopt some form of
social distancing and isolation of people. With lot of discussion and
debates on the effectiveness of state lockdown orders and attempts to
prevent people from gathering, I decided to make a simple comparison
of numbers. The data is publicly available from European Centre for
Dicease Prevention and Control
(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)
and New York Times (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).  

This is a simple excercise to compare total number of coronavirus cases found in Italy and the state of Florida, USA.
