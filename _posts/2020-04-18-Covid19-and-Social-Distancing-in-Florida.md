Coronavirus is affecting daily lives of people almost everywhere in the
world. The social impact as well as economic burden on personal and
state level is immense as countries and communities adopt some form of
social distancing and isolation of people. With lot of discussion and
debates on the effectiveness of state lockdown orders and attempts to
prevent people from gathering, I decided to make a simple comparison
of numbers. The data is publicly available from [European Centre for
Dicease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)
and [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data).  

Please note that this is a simple excercise to compare total number of
coronavirus cases found in Italy and the state of Florida, USA. The
population is Italy is about 2.8 times of Florida and therefore the
number of infections were devided by the population ratio. Also, the
cumilative curve of Florida was shifted forward by 44 days as the
covid19 infections started much earlier in Italy. The curves
surprisingly overlap until April 4th. Florida governer issed [stay at
home order](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/florida/articles/2020-04-01/florida-governor-issues-statewide-stay-at-home-order)
on April 1st effectiveon April 3rd and I am not sure this
is the single reason responsible for this improvement. I compared the
other states such as New York and did not find such an overlap.
